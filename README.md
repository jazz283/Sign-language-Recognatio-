Sign language, a unique and vital form of communication, is extensively used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities worldwide. Despite its importance, the recognition and understanding of sign language pose significant challenges in research and society. This communication gap, largely due to a lack of understanding among the general population, emphasizes the need for a solution. 
The aim of this graduation project is to bridge this communication gap, fostering inclusivity by enhancing the recognition and understanding of sign language.
The construction of the sign recognition system was made possible through the integration of several key components. These include preprocessing techniques that prepare the data for analysis, a Gesture Recognition Module that identifies specific sign language gestures, Â Computer Vision techniques that aid in gesture detection and recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP) that interprets spoken language, and a User Interface that presents the results in a user-friendly manner.
